My bunions...they're so rusty again!

RDP runs on 3389
Username: WhiteRabbit
Password: followme
Host range 172.18.30.0 - 172.18.30.255

1. Scan range with nmap. Find hosts with 3389. Try “rdesktop”
2. The host that accepts that username and password is stage 1. You should find hints as txt files that lead to the remaining 3 stages (4 total).
3. It’s easiest to go in order, but you do not have to. 
4. Flags for the first 2 are “username:password” (usernames must be lowercase). The username and password above are not the first flag. Sorry
